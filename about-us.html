            <p>Dr Scholl (owner of Dr. Scholl’s Orthopedic Footwear) and Carl Berg (owner of the Carlsberg Group & Holsten Brewery) we’re long-time friends. They would be questioned if they were related due to the amount of resemblance between the two quite often. Now the answer was always “no” until one cold winter night.</p>

            <p>Dr Scholl was hanging out in his luxury condo in his hometown of London, Ontario when he received a phone call late at night. Now, as many know, no phone calls late at night are normally good news. That being said, Scholl was very hesitant to pick up the phone. Ten minutes go by, and Scholl’s wife claims she has never seen a bigger smile on his face ever, period.</p>

            <p>Scholl instantly picked up his cell phone to call long-time friend, Carl Berg. His wife was still confused as to where all of his sudden excitement had come from. When Carl Berg picked up the phone, Scholl explained he had just received a call from the hospital stating that they were brothers. Both Scholl and Carl Berg grew up under the impression they were adopted, therefore, the news that they had found they’re biological brother was “the best day of my life” said Scholl in an interview shortly after major news outlets finding out.</p>

            <p>The two long-time friends turned into long-lost brothers. With their new found love for each other, and both of them owning and operating two of the largest companies in the world. They decided to do the impossible, combine the pre-existing branding of Dr Scholl’s and they great taste of the premium Dutch beer Holsten into one. Now that you know the backstory to the newly branded Holsten Brewery, it’s time to sit back, relax, and...</p>
